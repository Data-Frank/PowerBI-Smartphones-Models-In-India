## Conclusion
- Most models are below â‚¬400, with the median at â‚¬197. 
- Android is with 92.67% the most used OS. This makes sense, because Apple is the only real alternative and has only limited amount of models. 
- The brand with the most models is Xiaomi with 133 models!
- There is a small correlation between technical capabilities and price, but it does vary a lot.
- Number of front and back cameras clearly do have a strong relation with the price.
  



## Recommendation
- One could focus on more the luxerious segment, since there are very few phones above 2K. Before doing this I would recommend researching the sales of these products first.
- Since there is only a small correlation between selling price and the technical features of a phone, I would recommend considering on how much it costs to upgrade the technical features versus how much one could increase the selling price by doing this.
- Since there is strong correlation between selling price and the amount of cameras of a phone, I would recommend considering on how much it costs to increase the amount of cameras on the phone versus how much one could increase the selling price by doing this.
